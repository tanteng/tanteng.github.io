  <p>They were very serious and looked me straight in the eye. They said, &#8220;We specifically picked you out.&#8221; Both of my parents said that and repeated it slowly for me. And they put an emphasis on every word in that sentence. Abandoned. Chosen. Special. Those concepts became part of who Jobs was and how he regarded himself. His closest friends think that the knowledge that he was given up at birth left some scars. &#8220;I think his desire for complete control of whatever he makes derives directly from his personality and the fact he was abandoned from birth.&#8221;</p>

<p>“The key question about Steve is why he can&#8217;t control himself at times from being so reflexively cruel and harmful to some people,” he said. &#8220;That goes back to being abandoned at birth. The real underlying problem was the theme of abandonment in Steve&#8217;s life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Knowing I was adopted may have made me feel more independent, but I have never felt abandoned. I&#8217;ve always felt special. My parents made me feel special.</p>
